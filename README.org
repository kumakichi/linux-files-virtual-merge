* Usage
  Normally, after downloading file parts from internet, we use :
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    cat file.part1 file.part2 ... > file
  #+END_SRC

  But i don't want to create a new file, so i wrote this script to 'merge'(virtually) file parts into one file
* How to use

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ls
  demo.mp3
  $ split -b 3000000 demo.mp3 
  $ ls
  demo.mp3  xaa  xab  xac
  $ ./virtualMerge.sh xa*
  [sudo] password for san: 
  created /dev/mapper/joined
  remember to clean environment using cleaner20151215153514.sh
  $ sudo mplayer /dev/mapper/joined # use it
  $ ./cleaner20151215153514.sh # clean environment
#+END_EXAMPLE
* Todo

  support user-defined mapper filename
